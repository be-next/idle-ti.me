Hi! My name is **JÃ©rÃ´me Ramette**. I live in a small village near Paris in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Since a long long while, I have nurtured a profound passion for information technology, a field in which I have continuously engaged, particularly through software development and free software support.

My interest in artificial intelligence, dating back to the 1990s, was solidified by earning a postgraduate degree (DEA) in this specialized area. I'm glad I've lived long enough to see these technologies come to fruition.

I'm currently in charge of an IT performance team for a French railway company, but my role goes beyond that. I also work as a consultant on a number of assignments, contributing my expertise in consultancy, securing information system transformation trajectories and remediation.

This versatility and my ability to navigate the different aspects of the IT sector is my greatest pleasure.

To tell you a bit more about me, here's a peaces of my IT history so far...

## My first times
### The first computers
The fist computer I had access to was the famous [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81). We were in early 1980's (for the youger of us: imagine living in [Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9EkMc79ZSU)), the Cold War was in full swing and we were facinated by the [Wargames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQUsLAAZuhU) film!

It belongs to a different era!

### The first Linux distribution ##
The first linux distribution I have installed is **Yggdrassil Plug And Play Linux Fall 1994**. This distribution was one of the first on CD ROM. Previously, Linux distributions were supplied on about fiveten 3 1/2 floppy disks!

I spent about 2 months making my computer fully compatible with this distribution, with at least one kernel build a day! I remember how difficult it was to master all the configuration files, especially the X11 configuration file and the screen clocks that I had to calculate myself!

### The first Internet connection
I had my first Internet connection in 1994. It was a 56k modem (US Robotics). We had a server at our university that was connected to the Internet (renater, the French university network). The game consisted of reaching this server and ask it to engage a connection back to our personal computer. In this way, we could connect to the Internet for as long as we wanted for a single telephone unit! What a luxury!

### The first job (and first fail)
My first IT job was in january 1998. I was hired as a software developer in a kind of start up. We had developed a computer in free access in a public place. The computer was connected to the Internet (via 2 RNIS connections, that cost a leg!) and we had developed a software that allowed the user to surf the web with telephone card. The business model was based on telephone card selling. The user had to buy a telephone card to be able to surf the web, the phone card was charged according to the time spent. We imagined that all peaple would use this system to surf the web. We were wrong. The company went bankrup few months later.

### The first IA project
In 2001, I developed a natural language SMS interface to cross-reference the content of CityVox (a sort of TripAdivor, before TripAdvisor and only in France), PagesJaunes (a business directory) and the geolocation platform of Orange (France's leading mobile operator). This work was carried out for Dejima on the basis of its natural language recognition technology (Dejima was acquired by Sybase in 2004). This system was capable of answering questions such as "Find me a good Italian in the area" or "What is the telephone number of the nearest pharmacy? It was very cool and very useful!
This service was used for several years by Orange.
