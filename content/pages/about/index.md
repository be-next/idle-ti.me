Hi! I'm **Jérôme Ramette**, an IT performance team manager.

To tell you a little about myself, here's my computer history so far...

## The first computers ##
The fist computer I had access to was the famous [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81). We were in early 1980's (for the youger of us: imagine living in [Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9EkMc79ZSU) TV show), the Cold War was in full swing and we were facinated by the [Wargames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQUsLAAZuhU) film!



## The first Linux distribution ##
The first linux distribution I have installed is **Yggdrassil Plug And Play Linux Fall 1994**. I spent about 3 month to make my computer fully compatible with this distribution, and to master all configuration files (especially the X11 configuration file and the screen clocks that I had to calculate by myself)!
