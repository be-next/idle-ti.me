Hi! My name is **JÃ©rÃ´me Ramette**. I live in a small village near Paris in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

Since a long long while, I have nurtured a profound passion for information technology, a field in which I have continuously engaged, particularly through software development and free software support.

My interest in artificial intelligence, dating back to the 1990s, was solidified by earning a postgraduate degree (DEA) in this specialized area. I'm glad I've lived long enough to see these technologies come to fruition.

I'm currently in charge of an IT performance team for a French railway company, but my role goes beyond that. I also work as a consultant on a number of assignments, contributing my expertise in consultancy, securing information system transformation trajectories and remediation.

This versatility and my ability to navigate the different aspects of the IT sector is my greatest pleasure.

To tell you a bit more about me, here's a peaces of my IT history so far...

## My first times
### The first computers ##
The fist computer I had access to was the famous [Sinclair ZX81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81). We were in early 1980's (for the youger of us: imagine living in [Stranger Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9EkMc79ZSU)), the Cold War was in full swing and we were facinated by the [Wargames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQUsLAAZuhU) film!

It belongs to a different era!

### The first Linux distribution ##
The first linux distribution I have installed is **Yggdrassil Plug And Play Linux Fall 1994**. This distribution was one of the first on CD ROM. Previously, Linux distributions were supplied on about fiveten 3 1/2 floppy disks!

I spent about 2 months making my computer fully compatible with this distribution, with at least one kernel build a day! I remember how difficult it was to master all the configuration files, especially the X11 configuration file and the screen clocks that I had to calculate myself!
