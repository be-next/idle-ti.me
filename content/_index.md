Welcome to my personal website. On this platform, I humbly share my thoughts and insights, drawing from personal experiences and projects. The core subjects I delve into are primarily computer science, travel, and music, although I occasionally explore other topics as well.

In my idle time, I like to think that my CPU isn't entirely asleep ðŸ˜‰
