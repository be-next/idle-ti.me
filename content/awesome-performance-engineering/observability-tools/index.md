> A curated, opinionated list of tools and resources dedicated to **Observability** as an engineering capability — not just monitoring.

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a system by examining its outputs — **metrics, logs, traces, and profiles** — in order to explain *why* a system behaves the way it does, including in ways you didn't anticipate.

This list focuses on **modern observability practices** while acknowledging **legacy and operations-oriented tools** when they meaningfully contribute to system understanding — because most real-world environments are hybrid.

---

## 🎯 Scope & Intent

This list is curated with the following principles:

* Observability as an **engineering capability**, not a product to buy
* Preference for **field-proven tools** over purely theoretical or early-stage solutions
* Explicit consideration of **system complexity, scale, cost, and operational constraints**
* Recognition that **OpenTelemetry is converging as the standard instrumentation layer** — but the ecosystem remains diverse
* Awareness that **AI is reshaping observability** — from anomaly detection to natural-language querying

The goal is to help practitioners:

* Choose tools adapted to their **context, scale, and maturity**
* Combine tools coherently rather than stack them blindly
* Build observability systems that actually support **debugging, diagnosis, and decision-making**

---
