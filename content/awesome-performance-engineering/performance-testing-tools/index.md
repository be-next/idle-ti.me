> A curated, opinionated list of tools and resources dedicated to **Performance Testing** as a continuous engineering practice — not just load generation.

Performance testing is about validating that systems behave acceptably under realistic conditions: expected load, peak traffic, degraded infrastructure, and adversarial scenarios. Done well, it provides **confidence before deployment and evidence after incidents**.

This list covers the full performance testing lifecycle — from **workload design and data generation** through **load execution and chaos injection** to **results analysis and CI/CD integration**.

---

## 🎯 Scope & Intent

This list is curated with the following principles:

* Performance testing as a **continuous discipline**, not a pre-release gate
* Emphasis on **realistic workloads** — production-like data, traffic patterns, and failure modes
* Recognition that **shift-left performance** is essential — catching regressions in CI, not in staging
* Tools that **complement observability** — because load generation without visibility is noise
* Inclusion of **chaos engineering** as integral to performance validation — systems must perform under failure, not just under load

The goal is to help practitioners:

* Select tools adapted to their **technology stack, team size, and maturity**
* Build **repeatable, realistic performance test suites** that evolve with the system
* Integrate performance feedback into **delivery pipelines** rather than treating it as a separate phase

## HTTP Benchmarking & Micro-Benchmarking

*High-precision tools for measuring HTTP server throughput, latency distributions, and saturation behavior. Complementary to full load testing — focused on raw numbers rather than user scenarios.*

* **[wrk2](https://github.com/giltene/wrk2)** 🚀 — Constant-throughput HTTP benchmarking tool that produces accurate latency histograms (HdrHistogram). Fixes the coordinated omission problem present in most benchmarking tools. Essential for understanding true tail latency. Stable but not actively maintained (last significant commits ~2019). [C] [Apache-2.0]
* **[wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk)** 🚀 — Modern HTTP benchmarking tool with Lua scripting. Fast and simple, but susceptible to coordinated omission. Best used for relative comparisons, not absolute latency measurement. Stable, minimal recent activity. [C] [Apache-2.0]
* **[Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)** 🟢🚀🔗 — HTTP load testing tool with constant request rate mode. Clean CLI, library usage in Go, and built-in plotting. Good for saturation testing. [Go] [MIT]

> **A note on coordinated omission:** Many benchmarking tools (including wrk, ab, and hey) report misleadingly optimistic latencies because they don't account for queuing delay when the server is overloaded. Tools like wrk2, Vegeta (constant-rate mode), and Hyperfoil explicitly address this. For serious latency analysis, this matters. See [Gil Tene's talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ8ydIuPFeU) for the full explanation.

*AI is entering the performance testing lifecycle — from test generation and workload modeling to results analysis. For the broader perspective on AI in performance engineering, see the [README](@/awesome-performance-engineering/_index.md).*

Key areas where AI delivers value in performance testing today:

* **Test script generation** — LLMs generate k6, Gatling, or JMeter scripts from OpenAPI specs, reducing scaffolding effort
* **Workload modeling** — AI analyzes production traffic patterns to generate statistically representative load profiles
* **Automated results analysis** — ML-based anomaly detection flags regressions that static thresholds miss (gradual degradation, bimodal latency distributions)
* **Natural language querying** — asking "what caused the latency spike at minute 12?" instead of navigating dashboards

### Tools & Integrations

* **[k6 Cloud Performance Insights](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/k6/)** 🟠 — Automated analysis of k6 test results. Identifies performance issues, correlates metrics, and suggests root causes. [Commercial]
* **[Datadog Synthetic Monitoring + AI](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/)** 🟠 — Synthetic API and browser tests with ML-powered anomaly detection and intelligent alerting. Correlates synthetic test failures with APM traces. [Commercial]
* **[Dynatrace Load Testing Integration](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/deliver/test-pipeline-observability)** 🟠 — Automated quality gates in CI/CD using AI-based performance evaluation. Davis AI compares test results against baselines and detects anomalies in real time. [Commercial]
* **[Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com/)** 🟢🔗 — Monitoring-as-code with Playwright-based synthetic tests. AI-assisted test generation from browsing sessions (beta). [TypeScript] [Free tier/Commercial] — [GitHub](https://github.com/checkly/checkly-cli)
* **LLM-assisted test scripting** — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and similar AI coding assistants are increasingly effective at generating load test scripts from natural language descriptions or API specifications. Not a standalone tool, but a workflow shift worth noting.

### What's Coming Next

* **Adaptive quality gates** — AI that learns performance baselines across releases and detects statistically significant regressions beyond static thresholds
* **Self-tuning load scenarios** — dynamic adjustment of workload profiles (ramp-up, request mix, data patterns) based on observed system behavior during tests
* **Performance copilots** — AI assistants for end-to-end test strategy: design, execution, analysis, and optimization recommendations
* **Predictive impact analysis** — given a code change (PR diff), predicting which performance aspects are affected and recommending targeted tests

> **Practitioner's view:** AI is most valuable for eliminating **mechanical work** (script scaffolding, result triage, report generation) and augmenting **analytical tasks** (identifying regressions, correlating signals). It does not replace workload design thinking, system understanding, or architectural judgment. Use AI to generate the first draft, then apply engineering expertise to make it realistic.
