The 'WAZE Syndrome' is a metaphor describing our tendency to blindly
follow technologies, especially those claiming to simplify our
decision-making processes, like the WAZE navigation app. This syndrome
may extend to our interactions with generative artificial intelligences
(such as GPT-4, DALL-E, etc.), which are trained on vast data sets and
produce content that appears persuasive.

Generative AIs, though sophisticated, are not free from bias.
These biases may stem from the selection of training data,
how algorithms interpret this data, and the implicit or explicit objectives
of those who develop and utilize them. For instance, if an AI is predominantly
trained on data from Western sources, it might not be representative
of diverse global perspectives.

By delegating our thinking and decision-making to these systems,
we risk being subtly influenced by these biases. This can insidiously
shape our worldview and values. For example, if a generative AI
predominantly produces images in a style aligning with certain aesthetic
standards, users may subconsciously start to favor those standards
over others. Similarly, if a generative AI writes primarily in a
particular style or tone, it could influence how users expect information
to be presented, potentially excluding styles that might be more nuanced
or accurate in some contexts.

Understanding AI bias sensitivity is crucial for responsible use.
It is vital to question the results provided by AI, understand the
limits of these technologies, and recognize that our own judgment remains
an integral part of the decision-making process. This requires continuous
education on how AIs function, their strengths and weaknesses, and a
commitment to diversifying the datasets and perspectives incorporated
into the AI development process.
