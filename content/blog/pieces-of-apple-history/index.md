Born in earlier 70s, I discovered the Apple universe during my childhood through computer magazines (the rare French computer magazines!), at a time when personal computers were still a novelty. While my experience was personal, it reflects that of many technology enthusiasts who grew up during this pivotal era, each discovering these machines through magazines, computer stores, or school computers.
In this post, I have gathered documentaries that tell the story of this era through the lens of Apple. Each one captures a different aspect of this transformation: the broader revolution of personal computing, the unique relationship between users and their machines, the vision that drove these changes, and the lasting impact on those who embraced these technologies.
While reading those magazines as a child, I was part of a larger story unfolding - one where enthusiasts, developers, and users were gradually discovering the potential of personal computing. This story isn't just about technology; it's about how people connected with these tools, often before their peers understood their significance.
Through these films, we can understand how our personal histories connect to the larger narrative of personal computing's evolution. They provide a glimpse into the passion, innovation, and vision that drove this transformation.

## Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview (2012)

"Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview" is a documentary film released in 2012 that consists of a 70-minute interview with Steve Jobs conducted by [Robert X. Cringely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_X._Cringely) in 1995, during Jobs' time at NeXT Computer, before his return to Apple.
The interview was originally recorded for the PBS documentary series "Triumph of the Nerds" (1996), but only a small portion was used in the final series. The full interview footage was thought to be lost until a VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage after Jobs' death in 2011.
The interview is particularly significant because it captures Jobs at a unique moment in his career - after his departure from Apple but before his triumphant return. During this candid conversation, Jobs discusses various topics including:

- His early days at Apple and the creation of the Macintosh
- His perspective on the technology industry and its future
- His bitter departure from Apple in 1985
- His thoughts on Microsoft and Bill Gates
- His vision for digital technology and personal computing
- His management philosophy and approach to product development

The interview is notable for Jobs' candid and sometimes sharp criticisms of Apple's then-current management and Microsoft's approach to software development. He appears remarkably open and direct, offering insights into his thinking that weren't often captured in other interviews.
The film is valued not only for its historical significance but also for how it shows Jobs' consistent vision for technology and design - many of the ideas he discusses would later be implemented when he returned to Apple. It provides a fascinating glimpse into the mind of one of technology's most influential figures at a pivotal moment in his career.
What makes this interview particularly interesting is that it shows Jobs during what many consider his "wilderness years" - yet his characteristic passion, vision, and occasional sharp criticism of others remain fully intact. It's considered one of the most comprehensive and revealing interviews Jobs ever gave.
