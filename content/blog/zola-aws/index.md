As we all do, the first thing I have done to deploy my Zola website using S3 Bucket and CloudFront is to follow the [Zola documentation](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/aws-s3/). And... once deployed, I find that the site doesn't work as well as expected.

I was faced with the following problems:

  - When I try to access a sub-page, the website does not redirect to the `index.html` file. To solve this problem, I had to create a CloudFront function (it could have been a Lambda@Edge) to point directly to the `index.html` file.
  - The `404.html` error file is not working as expected. When I try to access a non-existent page, the `404.html` file is not displayed but I get a 403 error instead. To solve this problem, I had to configure the **error pages** in the CloudFront distribution.
  - The ressources are not updated when I update files in the S3 bucket. This is because the ressources are cached by CloudFront. To solve this problem, it's needed to invalidate the CloudFront cache when the website is updated (the deployement GitHub action given in Zola documentation provides a way to invalidate le cache CloudFront lors du deployment). And, it could be usefull to add a versionning to the ressources (that allows to update and serve ressources in S3 bucket without invalidate all cache).

In this article, I share the method I used to solve these problems. Let me know if there are simpler or more effective methods!

## Redirecting to the file: CloudFront Function

### `index.html` redirection

When we access a sub-page of the website, it is not redirected to the `index.html` file. And if you've configured the `404.html` error file as described below, you'll get a 404 error instead of the expected page.
CloudFront provides a root object parameter by default, but as its name suggests, it only works for the root of the website! Fortunately, CloudFront also provides a mechanism called CloudFront Functions that allows URLs to be automatically rewritten.
To create a CloudFront function that correctly redirects to `index.html` files, you can follow the example provided by AWS:

  - [Add index.html to request URLs that donâ€™t include a file name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/example-function-add-index.html)
  - [GithHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-cloudfront-functions/tree/main/url-rewrite-single-page-apps)

This exemple provides the following code to create a CloudFront function:

```javascript, linenos
function handler(event) {
    var request = event.request;
    var uri = request.uri;

    // Check whether the URI is missing a file name.
    if (uri.endsWith('/')) {
        request.uri += 'index.html';
    }
    // Check whether the URI is missing a file extension.
    else if (!uri.includes('.')) {
        request.uri += '/index.html';
    }
    return request;
}
```
Once you created and deployed this function, you have to associate this function (which I've called `Rewrite_URL` in this example) with the default `Default (*)` behaviour of the CloudFront distribution:

### i18n redirection

I don't yet deployed a multilingual website using Zola and this deployment method. But I think that we need to create a function and a behaviour for each language.

The function for the french (fr) language should look like this:

```javascript, linenos
function handler(event) {
    var request = event.request;
    var uri = request.uri;

    if (uri.endsWith('/') && uri.startsWith('/fr/')) {
        request.uri = uri + 'index.fr.html';
    }

    return request;
}
```
And the behaviour should capture the `/fr/*` path model.

To be continued...

## 404 Not Found error handling

### Problem statement

When accessing non-existent pages or resources on a static website generated with Zola and hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket served through CloudFront, we encounter a 403 Forbidden error instead of the expected 404 Not Found error. This issue arises despite CloudFront having permissions to access existing objects. The S3 bucket has public access blocked to prevent direct access, ensuring that CloudFront is the only entry point for users.

### Undelying cause

The 403 Forbidden error occurs because, with public access blocked, S3 does not differentiate between unauthorized access and non-existent resources for requests coming through CloudFront. Although this setup enhances security by restricting direct access, it inadvertently impacts the user experience by providing a misleading error message for missing content.

### Solution: Configuring CloudFront and S3 for Correct Error Handling

#### Check OAI Access to S3 Bucket

Folowing [the official AWS developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started-cloudfront-overview.html) guide, we should have created an OAI (Origin Access Identity) for CloudFront to access the S3 bucket. This OAI is used to restrict access to the S3 bucket to only CloudFront. This is done by updating the bucket policy to allow access to the OAI.

This policy should look like this:

```json, linenos
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity YOUR_OAI_ID"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
Where you have to replace `YOUR_OAI_ID` with the OAI ID you created and `yourbucketname` with the name of your bucket.

#### Configure custom Error Pages in CloudFront

To handle 404 errors correctly, we need to configure custom error pages in CloudFront. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Go to the CloudFront distribution for your website.
2. Choose the **Error Pages** tab.
3. Choose **Create Custom Error Response**.
4. In the **HTTP Error Code** field, enter 403: Forbidden.
5. In the **Error Caching Minimum TTL** field, enter 0.
6. In the **Customize Error Response** section, choose **Yes** for **Customize Error Response**.
7. In the **Response Page Path** field, enter /404.html.
8. In the **HTTP Response Code** field, enter 404: Not Found.
9. Choose **Create**.

There is no need to configure the 404 error page in this way, as the 404 error will never be triggered. In fact, as we have seen, a non-existent resource triggers a 403 error, which is now tracked by the CloudFront distribution to return a 404 error.

## CloudFront cache management

By default, CloudFront caches the resources it serves for 24 hours[^1]. This means that when you update a file in the S3 bucket, the changes are not immediately visible on the website. To solve this problem, you can invalidate the CloudFront cache when the website is updated. And you can also add a versionning to the ressources (that allows to update and serve ressources in S3 bucket without invalidate all cache).

### Cache invalidation

#### GitHub Action
If you use GitHub Action to deploy your website, the Zola documentation provides a way to invalidate the CloudFront cache when the website is updated. Here the deployment GitHub Action I use to deploy my website to S3 and invalidate the CloudFront cache:

```yaml, linenos
name: Build and Publish to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: recursive
      - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
        with:
          tool: zola@0.18.0
      - name: Build
        run: zola build
      - uses: reggionick/s3-deploy@v4
        env:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        with:
          folder: public
          bucket: ${{ secrets.S3_BUCKET }}
          private: true
          bucket-region: us-east-1
          # Use the next two only if you have created a CloudFront distribution
          dist-id: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID }}
          invalidation: /*
```

#### Command line
You can install the `aws` command line tool using the `taiki-e/install-action` action and then use the `aws cloudfront create-invalidation` command to invalidate the CloudFront cache. The `invalidation: /*` parameter is used to invalidate the entire CloudFront cache.

```bash
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

### Ressources versionning

To avoid invalidating the entire CloudFront cache when updating a file in the S3 bucket, you can add versioning to resources. This is done by enabling versioning in the S3 bucket and adding a query string to the URL of the resource in the CloudFront distribution.

#### S3 bucket versioning

To enable versioning in the S3 bucket, simply go to the S3 bucket properties and enable versioning.

Once versioning has been activated, don't forget to create a lifecycle rule to delete old versions of files. To do this, simply go to S3 bucket management and create a lifecycle rule. For example, you can create a rule to delete old versions of files after 5 days (that's what I've set).

#### CloudFront distribution configuration

To add a query string to the URL of the resource in the CloudFront distribution, you can use the `Behavior` tab of the CloudFront distribution. You can add a query string to the URL of the resource by adding a `versionId` query string to the `Cache key and origin requests` of the `Default (*)` behaviour.
